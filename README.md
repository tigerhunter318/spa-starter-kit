# Codecast's SPA Starter Kit

> A **highly opinionated** Single Page Application starter kit built on top of Vue.js and Laravel.

This package contains two separate projects to act as a starting point for a Single Page Application: a Vue.js project (created with vue-cli + webpack template) and a Laravel 5.3 project.

They're not just freshly created projects but a fully working application that can be modified and expanded to become your own application.

    * Authentication with JWT
    * Keep user signed in using local stored info
    * HTTP requests with Axios
    * ESList, no semi-colons
    * Pagination integrated with Laravel's LengthAwarePaginator
2. Server side
    * Laravel 5.3
    * Authentication with JWT
    * Web service RESTful with Dingo *(planned)*
