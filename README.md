# Codecast's SPA Starter Kit

This package contains two separate projects to act as a starting point for a Single Page Application: a Vue.js project (created with vue-cli + webpack template) and a Laravel 5.3 project.

They're not just freshly created projects but a fully working application that can be modified and expanded to become your own application.
